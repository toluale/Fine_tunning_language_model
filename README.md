# Fine_tunning_language_model
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Flan-T5 model using Hugging Face's Transformers library with bfloat16 precision. By leveraging bfloat16, you can achieve faster training times and reduced memory usage on supported hardware (e.g., TPUs or recent GPUs with bfloat16 capabilities) while maintaining sufficient numerical precision.
